# Simple-Linear-Regression
Simple linear regression model to predict Sales using an appropriate predictor variable.

Equation of linear regression

𝑦=𝑐+𝑚1𝑥1+𝑚2𝑥2+...+𝑚𝑛𝑥𝑛 

𝑦  is the response

𝑐  is the intercept

𝑚1  is the coefficient for the first feature

𝑚𝑛  is the coefficient for the nth feature


In our case:

𝑦=𝑐+𝑚1×𝑇𝑉 

The  𝑚  values are called the model coefficients or model parameters.
